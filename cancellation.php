			<h4>Change of parcel weight or dimensions</h4>
			<br>
			<div class="banner_bottom_left">
				<p>It is essential when booking a parcel, to provide the accurate dimensions and weight of your item. This will ensure the item will not be returned or refused by the couriers on the grounds of being incorrectly measured, and that no additional weight charge will be applied. The couriers themselves apply these charges on items that have been misdeclared as they use volumetric weight. You should weigh and measure your item once it is packed and ready, this will make sure the correct measurements are provided into our quote engine. If you need to make any change on your order to the weight or dimensions you will need to cancel and rebook as we are unable to adjust these on your booking. Just let us know you need to cancel, we will action it for you and you will recieve a refund. </p>	
				<p>If you have the message 'Problem please contact us' this is generally something we can fix for you too, or we can investigate and tell you what the problem is to come up with a resolution.</p>
				<p>If you need cancel you can also raise a <a href="#">support@donkeycargo.com</a> and this will be resolved by our team.</p>
